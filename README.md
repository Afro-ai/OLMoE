## OLMoE

This repository provides an overview of all resources for the paper "OLMoE: ...".


### Training

1. Clone [OLMo](https://github.com/allenai/OLMo) & create an environment with its dependencies via `cd OLMo; pip install -e .`
2. Run `pip install git+https://github.com/Muennighoff/megablocks.git@olmoe`
3. Setup a config file, there are a ton of config files in `configs/` (TODO: Add these)
4. Download the data from TODO & adapt the paths in your config file as needed
5. Submit your job. We used `bash olmoe.sh` using [beaker gantry](https://github.com/allenai/beaker-gantry) but you will likely need to change the script to work with your setup.
